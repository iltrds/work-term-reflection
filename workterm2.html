                <p class="lead">This page will cover my first co-op work term in my computer science program at the University of Guelph. I was able to successfully complete my first co-op work term taken over the course of the Summer 2025 (May-August) term in which I was given the opportunity to contribute in meaningful ways to the modernization and expansion of my employer via my role as an IT Operations Co-op Student.

                <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
                <p>I was employed as an IT Operations Co-op with Styled Co/The Paper Bride in Chatham, Ontario. The employer specializes in event planning, coordination, and decor (primarily with weddings). They’ve been in business for 21 years and recently won the Medium Business of the Year award from the Municipality of Chatham-Kent. Whilst the business itself is not primarily focused on computing, their business is still majority digital and use commercial softwares for things like inventory tracking, inquires, and invoices.

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>While employed, I had established a few goals to further my development in IT, which were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Literacy</strong>: Improve Technical Literacy by Earning Microsoft AZ-900 Certification</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem Solving</strong>: Reduce manual workloads by creating automated tools (e.g., Google Sheets scripts, macros).</li>
                    <li><strong>Personal learning goal</strong>: Modernize Wix websites by applying SEO and mobile-friendly design principles.</li>
                    <li><strong>Leadership</strong>: Successfully coordinate the company's internet upgrade from DSL to Fibre Optic.</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral Communication</strong>: Improve device security by mastering antivirus management and threat mitigation.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>I was hired on as an IT Operations Co-op Student with the goal of automating some of the more tedious tasks. Styled Co has been rooted in the community for decades, but as a result of their age and lack of a proper IT department they struggled to shift from paper to digital. Over the course of my tenure, I was assigned to remodel their websites (styledco.ca, thepaperbride.ca) and automate tasks such as payroll, timesheets, quotes, and invoices via Google sheets.</p>
            </div>
        </section>

        <section id="conclusions">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p><strong>Technological Literacy: </strong>When I started the co-op, I was already progressing through the online learning modules for Microsoft Azure and Cloud computing concepts. However, I quickly learned that the size of the business I was serving could not justify a cloud computing-based solution, so my priorities shifted away from cloud computing and towards more practical topics, such as learning the systems already put in place (the company uses Wix for their websites and Honeybook for wedding/event inquiries). In the end, I did not accomplish this goal and did not earn the Microsoft AZ-900 Certification. I am confident I will be able to fulfill this goal in the future and I have learned many other SaaS solutions through my time at Styled co.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem Solving: </strong>I believe I met this goal very strongly during this co-op work term. Initially, I had a very limited understanding of Google Sheets and Microsoft Excel formulas. However, some of my first tasks involved reducing the redundancy and manual workload of calculating payroll for contract workers. They already had been using Google Sheets to track monthly hours which gave me the perfect opportunity to learn formulas. Over the course of my time spent with Styled Co, I have successfully automated portions of their decor quotes, invoices, payroll, and general sales all while learning a significant amount about Google Sheets.</p>
                <p><strong>Personal Learning Goal: </strong>Over the summer, I had the chance to modernize 3 of Styled Co’s websites, with the primary website being styledco.ca. I not only learned a lot about SEO, but I had the chance to get some pages on the website listed on Google for the first time (half the website hadn’t even been indexed by Google, meaning they were potentially missing out on 50% of their customer base via Google). Additionally to SEO, I modernized the website to make it mobile compatible (later analytics show that roughly 60% of visitors to the website were mobile users!). This combination of SEO, mobile friendly design, and overall modernization saw an overall 22% increase in traffic to the website over the summer compared to previous time periods.</p>
                <p><strong>Leadership: </strong>One of my first objectives was to get the internet plan upgraded. The company was operating on dial up internet when I arrived, which only allowed for 2 computers to do the bare minimum (emails, google) and very slowly at that. Any phones or videos/music would cause the internet to buckle. I coordinated the upgrade to fibre optic by consulting 3 ISPs that operated in the area and led the upgrade with the company I suggested that would not only be the best value, but also the best customer support after I was finished with my work term since the remainder of the company wasn’t very tech savvy. In the end, we successfully upgraded to fibre optic and business flows WAY faster than before.</p>
                <p><strong>Oral Communication: </strong>I believe I only partially accomplished this goal. While I was successful in researching and downloading a reliable antivirus program on the computers, I did not fully explore the broader aspects of antivirus management or proactive threat mitigation. For example, I did not spend much time learning how to configure advanced settings, schedule scans, or interpret the reports generated by the software. I also didn’t practice identifying and responding to potential threats beyond relying on the program’s automatic features.</p>
                <p>Over the course of the 4-month work term, I’ve had the opportunity to work with multiple SaaS solutions and practically applied programs that I wouldn’t have otherwise considered to learn. I’ve learned proper web design and search engine optimization and refined my techniques through the analytics collected over the span of 4 months to further improve them. </p>
                <p>The hybrid scheme of working remote and in-person allowed me to learn how to reliably work independently towards clearly defined goals. It has allowed me to add many new skills to my resume and improve myself in the field of Computer Science.</p>

                <p>I would like to thank my supervisor, Jenn Babula, for her understanding and kindheartedness throughout the course of my co-op. While getting settled in, she was very prompt with advice and demonstrating how established processes were carried out at the company. </p>
                <p>I would also like to thank the co-op supervisors at the University of Guelph. They were indispensable in terms of resume feedback and pre-interview review calls. I am sure that I wouldn’t have gotten as far as I have without the reassurance their support has provided me.</p>
