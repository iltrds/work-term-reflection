                <p class="lead">This page will cover my second co-op work term in my computer science program at the University of Guelph. I was able to successfully complete my second co-op taken over the course of Fall 2025 as IT Support on the Hardware Support Services team working at Tech Hub.

                <h2>Information about the Employer</h2>
                <p>The City of Mississauga, consolidated in 1974, is a large municipality in the Province of Ontario. Under the Region of Peel, it is responsible for multiple essential community services such as the fire department, parks maintenance, bylaw enforcement, etc. As of 2025, the City employs roughly 6000 employees across the municipality and the IT department employs around 240 to support the large employee base.

                <h2>Goals</h2>
                <p>While employed, I had established a few goals to further my development in IT, which were:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Depth & Breadth of Understanding</strong>: Deepen my knowledge of potential career paths within the IT department of the municipality.</li>
                    <li><strong>Problem Solving</strong>: Gain experience resolving a wide array of level-2 technical support tickets.</li>
                    <li><strong>Technological Literacy</strong>: Improve technical portfolio by learning relevant IT softwares used by the City of Mississauga.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inquiry & Analysis </strong>: Learn more about the lifecycle of devices within the municipality by assisting with the decommissioning of city hardware (tablets, phones, laptops).</li>
                    <li><strong>Oral Communication</strong>: Develop my communication ability in order to properly and confidently resolve tickets in a large organization.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Job Description</h2>
                <p>I was hired as one of 6 IT Support co-op students for Hardware Support Services. Within the team I was assigned to the position of Tech Hub, a help desk located in the main floor of the civic centre where any staff in the city can approach us for direct person to person tech support. The position requires knowledge of all softwares that the city uses and in depth knowledge of the different teams that make up the IT Department in the event of ticket escalations.

        <section id="conclusions">
            <div class="container">
                <h2>Conclusions</h2>
                <p><strong>Depth & Breadth of Understanding: </strong>This goal was accomplished through interviewing my direct supervisor Rumesh Gamalathge on his journey through the city starting as a co-op student and working his way to supervisor. The second person at the city was the CIO and Director of IT Ryan Lim who organized a meeting in the first few weeks to introduce himself to the incoming co-ops. During the meeting, he explained his journey through the city including that he had started in 2003 as a co-op student as well. Overall, the interviews brought to light how much the city values their co-ops and co-op retention, since every manager above me was, at some point, a co-op student.</p>
                <p><strong>Problem Solving: </strong>This goal was initially established with the expectation that Tech Hub would handle many tickets through the ServiceNow portal. However, the majority of tickets that came to Tech Hub were external service calls that needed to be placed (ex. Warranty claims with Lenovo or Ricoh), and we were responsible instead for walk-ups and people having issues that needed to be addressed immediately. Due to the variety of problems that we were approached with, I’d consider this goal to be accomplished.</p>
                <p><strong>Technological Literacy: </strong>Tech Hub was the ideal location for this goal. As we were the go-to for any in person help a member of the city may need, we needed to be well-versed in all technologies used by every section of the city. The primary technologies we learned to troubleshoot were INFOR and SAP for hands-on departments like Transportation (bus service, parks & recreation), and Cisco AnyConnect VPN & the M365 office suite for workers within the civic centre. By the end of the co-op I was able to successfully locate the cause of the problem on the first try about 70% simply from gained expertise in city software and previous experience.</p>
                <p><strong>Inquiry & Analysis: </strong>Due to warranty, performance, and security reasons, every laptop at the city is replaced every 4 years. This translates to daily hardware upgrades, and Tech Hub works closely with the PC Replacement team to coordinate appointments with city staff to bring in their old laptop, ensure data is moved over, and accustom them to their new hardware. By the end of my co-op, I’ve helped/led hardware upgrades for well over 100 people and became very acquainted with the entire process from start to finish. I can safely say this goal was accomplished.</p>
                <p><strong>Oral Communication: </strong>The purpose of this goal was to be able to navigate an organization as large as the City of Mississauga in order to effectively delegate tasks filtered through Tech Hub. Over the course of the co-op, this goal was successfully accomplished through advice from fellow technicians and trail & error (if you sent a ticket to the wrong place, they send it right back). At Tech Hub, interactions with other teams within IT were necessary due to the massive variety of problems we had to deal with on a daily basis, so I became quite adept at knowing which team is responsible for different areas of the city.</p>

                <h2>Acknowledgments</h2>
                <p>I would like to thank my direct supervisor Rumesh Gamalathge for giving me the opportunity to work at the city and being extremely accommodating while I was getting settled in. It was very apparent from the start of the co-op that the IT Department highly values its co-op students and Rumesh, being a former co-op himself, was exemplary and prepared for some of the roadblocks at the city before I even knew they would be an issue.</p>
                <p>Additionally, I would like to thank Ladonna Wright. As Tech Hub is detached from the IT Department, Ladonna was responsible primarily for training me. While it was definitely a trial by fire, Ladonna was exemplary at reinforcing what I’ve learned with live examples and involving me when she saw opportunities for growth. </p>
                <p>Finally, I’d like to thank my fellow co-op students Austin Nicholson, Rhea Alvares, Sebastion Da Silva, Miguel Lumaban, and Jeff Pollock. The 6 of us interacted a lot over the course of the 4 month semester and, as it was none of our first co-ops, I learned a lot about the field of computer science through their previous experiences.</p>
